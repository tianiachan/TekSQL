#page 3 is reserved for SQL experimentation on Problem 3. 
#You're encouraged to experiment here but your final (tidy) answers must be on page 1. 
#TEMPORARY TABLEs are fun because you can query directly into them without constucting them first.
#Great for exploratory analysis.

DROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF EXISTS sales_data_all;

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE sales_data_all
#SELECT ...

SELECT count(*) from sales_data_all;

#Provide any other queries you used and wish to share. This is optional but hopefully valuable.
